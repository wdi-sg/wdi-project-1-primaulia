# The PRICE is RIGHT!

### Introduction
I used to watch this show almost everyday growing up and it's still fun to play at parties! The show itself has A LOT of games but I'll be going for the classic - guess the price of the items and win them!

### Game Concept/Flow

Here, my basic target will be to create a game for 2 players.
An item will be shown in the screen (with the price hidden) and the players will be prompted to give an `input` number.

Once each player `submits`, the input number of each player will be displayed and input fields will disabled, and the Reveal button will show.

(Not sure about the part on disabling input fields yet. May want it not to be disabled so that players can change their minds before clicking on the reveal button)

Once the `reveal` button is clicked, the price of the item will be revealed and at the same time the player inputs will be compared with the price of the item.

The player that has the lower price difference, either higher or lower from the item actual price, will win. Player number will be displayed `Congratulations! Player 1, you have won.. a NEW CARRRR!!!!`

And the game will restart with a new item (at this point I think I would just use preset items first.)

 ### My plan
 I forsee that I would be able to handle doing just one game for now. If I manage to reach the basic logic and skeleton of the game, I'd add in these features (to make it as close to the real game as possible!)
 1. 'ting' sound when players input their guess
 2. Color scheme - muted pink, blue, yellow, green.
 3. Allow for players to add their names and the winner name to use the players' actual name.
 4. Allow for 4 players

Additional stuff that is really extra
 1. "audience" pple giving random guesses to help the players.

### TO be added soon
 4. Code snippet for the custom logic part.
 5. Mini Journal - to show progress
 5. References
